        <p>Weronika Jaworska is an illustrator and pixel artist based in Bristol. Weronika initially focused her art practice on book illustrations, writing short stories and reimagining fairy tales which she drew inspiration from their underlying horror and playfulness. She is a versatile creator who likes to tap into different genres of art like etching, digital painting, traditional painting, graphic design and more recently pixel art. Video games are a great passion of Weronika and with exploring the world of pixel art and indie game development she plans to get more involved in independent video game projects similar to her latest work on Seweria.</p>
